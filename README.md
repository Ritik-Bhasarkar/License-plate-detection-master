Here we are using CNN based sliding window approach to build an automatic number plate recognition system. Detecting the number plate by pre build Har-cascade classifier.
Giving the input as a number plate, The trained CNN model will classify and predict the segmented input value. The dataset consist of 10 classes of different images of numbers and 27 classes of images of different alphabets.
